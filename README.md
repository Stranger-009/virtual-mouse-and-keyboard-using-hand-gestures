A virtual mouse and keyboard using hand gestures allows users to control a computer through hand movements instead of physical devices. By using cameras and computer vision, it tracks hand positions and gestures to perform actions like clicking, typing, or moving the cursor. This technology enhances accessibility and touchless interaction.
